# YOLO
This project showcases a real-time object detection system using YOLOv8 integrated with OpenCV. Built as part of my Summer Internship at IVIS LABS, the system captures live video from a webcam, detects and classifies objects (people, cars, buses, trucks, bicycles), and displays dynamic counts with annotated bounding boxes.
